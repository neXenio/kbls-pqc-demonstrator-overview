# KBLS Ã— neXboard

## Overview

In the KBLS project, cryptographic methods are developed that are robust against attacks from quantum computers. As a use
case, we use the web client of neXboard. neXboard provides a solution for digital whiteboards on which users can create and
edit post-its - collaboratively and in real time. The goal is to protect the content of the post-its in a quantum resistant
way without limiting the interactive possibilities of the board.

For this purpose, a so-called Board Key is created for each board, which symmetrically encrypts the post-its. The board key
itself is encrypted in such a way that it can be shared with any number of users with access rights and is protected in a
quantum-resistent manner. When a user's access rights are revoked, the board key changes to protect all future content.

In this way, we test and demonstrate the functionality, usability, and performance of the botan crypto library on the one
hand, and the practicality of a hybrid key agreement procedure on the other.

## Details

* [Context and Scope](./01-Context-and-Scope.md)
* [Proposed Architecture](./02-Proposed-Architecture.md)
* [API Specification + User Flows](./03-API-Specification+User-Flows.md)
* [Considerations for Further Development](./04-Considerations-for-Further-Development.md)
* [Test Vectors](./05-Test-Vectors.md)

## Outlook

We hope that the realization of the demonstrator will provide important insights into the following:

* Performance of botan in real-time collaboration
* Usability of botan
* Practicability of a hybrid key agreement procedure for crypto-agility

Building on the demonstrator, further security mechanisms can be designed and implemented in the future:

* Protection of other information (the title of a board, the color or position of a post-it, etc.)
* Authenticity through (hybrid) digital signatures
* Mechanisms to check completeness of encrypted data
* Storing key material at the client
